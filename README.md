### The work on this project will be divided into 4 sections:
1. Backlog Creation and Grooming :heavy_check_mark:
2. Investigation & Demo Project :heavy_check_mark:
3. Investigation of Software Engineering methods and functionalities used in the JASMINE TDDs project :heavy_check_mark:

 including:
    * Version Control System - the Entire JASMINE Project is saved and handled using GitHub.
    * TDDs - The project's main purpose is to give TDD abilities to JS Developers - even if it wasnt constructed with TDDs it is worh mentioning that this is the main SE practice this project is talking about.
    * Reuse - This project reuses multiple existing technologies from the web and JS word, some of them are AJAX, NodeJS and Pythons Egg, Ruby Gems and 
    * Backlog for Raised issues - https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues
    * Backlog for future releases(as User Stories) - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/10606
    * Use of Burnup Chart - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/reports/v2/projects/10606/overview?selected_tab=burnup
    * Use of Comulative flow chart - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/reports/v2/projects/10606/overview?selected_tab=flow
    * Use of Iterations(Sprints) of a week - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/reports/v2/projects/10606/iterations/current
    * Use of Story Points, Acceptans Criteria, Tasks and US within a sprint
  
4. Helping the JASMINE Project by trying to fix exiting issues within it :heavy_check_mark:
    * Fix for Issue #1317 - "Calling to toThrowError with no arguments erros via assuming the undefined argument is a regex" pull request was inserted.
